## Hello, `wasmbrowser`

This project was created from the `dotnet new wasmbrowser` template. It is a simple example of running .NET code in the browser without Blazor.

## Environment

```sh
dotnet workload install wasi-experimental
```

## Building & Running

You know the drill.

```sh
dotnet build
```

```sh
dotnet run
```

Enjoy the bouncing lines.
